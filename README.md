# [Forpy](https://github.com/ylikx/forpy) example

This is just a simple application of the Forpy library, using meson to compile it. I requires
python >3.8 to work, and [meson](https://mesonbuild.com/).

To compile use the following command:
```
meson build
meson compile -C build
```
The binary executable will be inside the build folder.
